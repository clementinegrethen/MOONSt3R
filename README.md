## üìÇ Dataset Description

Our dataset is provided in a format directly compatible with **DUSt3R/MASt3R training pipelines**.  
For each image, we include three synchronized files:

- **RGB image (`.jpg`)**  
  - Resolution: **512 √ó 512** pixels  
  - Standard 8-bit image for visualization and training.  
  - All images are expressed in a **selenocentric (Moon-centered) coordinate system**.

- **Depth map (`.exr`)**  
  - High-precision floating-point depth map (in meters).  
  - Encodes the distance from the camera to the visible surface for each pixel.  
  - Can be used to generate ground-truth 3D point clouds.

- **Camera metadata (`.npz`)**  
  - Contains the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration matrices:  
    - `intrinsics` (or `K`): 3√ó3 camera intrinsic matrix  
    - `extri` or `Rt`: 3√ó4 camera pose matrix (world‚Üícamera, OpenCV convention)  
    - Alternative fields (`fx`, `fy`, `cx`, `cy`) are also provided for compatibility.  
  - This ensures reproducible reprojections and geometric consistency.

## üìÅ Data Structure

A typical folder looks like this:
dataset_root/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.exr
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.npz
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.exr
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.npz
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

Each triplet `{.jpg, .exr, .npz}` corresponds to a single camera frame.

- In the repository, the folder **`DataGeneration/`** contains a **small example subset** of the dataset.  
  This is meant for quick testing.

- The dataset has been formatted to be **plug-and-play with DUSt3R/MASt3R**.  
  We also provide (üìå *TODO*) a **custom dataloader** that loads images, depth maps, and camera parameters in one call.
