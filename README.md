## üß™ Quick Testing

A folder with sample scenes for quick testing will be provided: [`quick_testing/`](quick_testing/) *(to be created)*

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Generation

The StereoLunar dataset is available [here](<link_to_database>).

Each scene contains images in 512x512 `.jpg` format, paired with:
- `.npz` file: camera intrinsics and extrinsics
- `.exr` file: depth map in metric scale

Example data structure:

```
scene_001/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.npz
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.exr
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.npz
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.exr
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## üì¶ DataLoader for LunarStereo

To train with the StereoLunar dataset, we provide a dataloader in [`mast3r/dust3r/dust3r/datasets/`](mast3r/dust3r/dust3r/datasets/) directly compatible with the format above. No preprocessing required.

Images are loaded as 512x512 `.jpg` files. Each view is paired with:
- a `.npz` file containing camera intrinsics and extrinsics
- a `.exr` file containing a depth map in metric scale

---

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Finetuning Example

To finetune on your own lunar dataset:

```python
# Example script
from mast3r.train import train
train(dataset_path='path/to/lunar_dataset', checkpoint='data_generation/mast3r/CHECKPOINTS/lunar_checkpoint.pth', ...)
```

---
## üìÇ Dataset Description

Our dataset is provided in a format directly compatible with **DUSt3R/MASt3R training pipelines**.  
For each image, we include three synchronized files:

- **RGB image (`.jpg`)**  
  - Resolution: **512 √ó 512** pixels  
  - Standard 8-bit image for visualization and training.  
  - All images are expressed in a **selenocentric (Moon-centered) coordinate system**.

- **Depth map (`.exr`)**  
  - High-precision floating-point depth map (in meters).  
  - Encodes the distance from the camera to the visible surface for each pixel.  
  - Can be used to generate ground-truth 3D point clouds.

- **Camera metadata (`.npz`)**  
  - Contains the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration matrices:  
    - `intrinsics` (or `K`): 3√ó3 camera intrinsic matrix  
    - `extri` or `Rt`: 3√ó4 camera pose matrix (world‚Üícamera, OpenCV convention)  
    - Alternative fields (`fx`, `fy`, `cx`, `cy`) are also provided for compatibility.  
  - This ensures reproducible reprojections and geometric consistency.

## üìÅ Data Structure

A typical folder looks like this:
dataset_root/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.exr
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00000.npz
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.jpg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.exr
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ im_00001.npz
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

Each triplet `{.jpg, .exr, .npz}` corresponds to a single camera frame.  

---


- In the repository, the folder **`DataGeneration/`** contains a **small example subset** of the dataset.  
  This is meant for quick testing.

- The dataset has been formatted to be **plug-and-play with DUSt3R/MASt3R**.  
  We also provide (üìå *TODO*) a **custom dataloader** that loads images, depth maps, and camera parameters in one call.
